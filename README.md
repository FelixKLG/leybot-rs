# Leybot

Hi, this is my Discord bot written in Rust to go alongside my other project [FelixKLG/linksite-v2](https://github.com/FelixKLG/linksite-v2).

It is almost complete and is under active development, I like the way it turned out.
Some things are likely subject to change and some features are yet to be implemented.

## Features

- Slash commands
- 'neat' design
- Automatically assigns verified role on join
- Send Embed welcome message

---

### Commands

- /gmodstore
- /steam
- /roles
- /force-roles
- /purchases
- /unlink
- /coupon
