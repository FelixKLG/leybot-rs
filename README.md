# Leybot
Hi, this is my Discord bot written in Rust to go alongside my other project FelixKLG/linksite-v2.

It is almost complete and is under active development, I like the way it turned out.
Some things are likely subject to change and some features are yet to be implemented.

*Ignore compilation warnings, they are because not all features are pushed yet but the underlying code may still be present*


## Features
- Slash commands
- 'neat' design
- Automatically assigns verified role on join

## WIP Features
- Coupon command
- Send Embed welcome message

---

### Commands
- /gmodstore
- /steam
- /roles
- /force-roles
- /purchases
- /unlink
- /coupon *(not yet finished)*
